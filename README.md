# Vulners Hack Quests
Some easy / and not hack quests.
Take a try!

## ZIP brute challenge

Password protected archives are common cases. But can you brute them effectively?
Take a look at the files:
* Easy: isox_zipquest_novice.zip
* Medium 1: isox_zipquest_hint.zip
* Medium 2: isox_zipquest_1.zip

Can you decrypt and open them?
Easy level is CTF-style.
Medium are protected by the short passwords (<=5).
And it's not a task about making GPU farm for the bruteforce!
